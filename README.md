# Our goal

We work in different projects, in several regional areas. Therefore it is complicated to sustain and concetrate the strong we-spirit. For this reason TED is beeing found.

With TED we want to strengthen the team-spirit and to take advantage of synergies that comes with continoues exchange with other colleagues. TED is more than an ordanary office meeting. In every TED we come together to talk, discuss and philosophise about actual project and technology topics, about software development and architecture solutions, about trends and new methods. In order to do so, TED has a big stake in practical do-it-yourself components, which allow participants to transfer things heard into practical know-how, which they can use in their projects aswell. Therefore it is necassary to voluntarily develop TEDnologies, which can be presented and discussed in a TED.

TEDno-what? TEDnologies! This is a container for every technology, application and method which were presented and discussed in previous TEDs. They contain overviews, how-to instructions, best practices and a Q&A area.

In this way sharing your know-how leads to knowledge building for the Düsseldorf office and total PRODYNA. As a useful secondary effect, employees in Düsseldorf get a chance to know eachother better and to increase their personal network.
